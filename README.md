# FIFA Stats Explorer

## Focus Topics
* Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript
* REST API and front-end development (Flask)
* Web-scraping (BeautifulSoup)
* SQLite DB management
* Plotting in the browser (Chart.js)

## Overview
A small side-project for some practice with a few skills.

Websites like FUTWIZ and Futhead provide information on in-game statistics of all Ultimate Team players. While you can compare stats of players, this is restricted to raw numbers on 40 different statistics. It can be difficult to make the right choice on which player to spend money on if you want to take a broad range of statistics or more than 2 or 3 players into consideration.

This simple app solves this problem by providing a quick and easy way to visualise and compare player statistics at a larger scale in a bar-chart, scatterplot or radar-chart with many players at once or many statistics at once.

## Features
Functionality includes... 
* adding players to an SQLite database using FUTWIZ url
* searching the database by player name
